            <h1 class="article-title">üö® Recruiter Scam Warning: Why Asking for a 1099 Tax Form is the Critical Red Flag
            </h1>

            <p class="lead-paragraph">
                I landed in Copenhagen on August 31st, 2025, in the middle of a brutal job search. When an email arrived
                from a recruiter at **Rose International** for a Data Labeling Analyst role with **Meta**, I was
                unguarded.
                This is the story of how a sophisticated scam unfolded, and the one request that immediately revealed
                their goal:
                **stealing my tax documents.**
            </p>

            <h2 id="section-initial-lure">The Setup: Jet Lag, Desperation, and a Perfect Offer</h2>

            <p>
                My flight from New York City had been delayed, and I arrived at Kastrup Airport with a week of jet lag
                ahead
                of me. As anyone in a tough job market knows, you seize every opportunity. A few days after arriving, I
                got
                an email from **Ali Farhan**, a recruiter claiming to be from **Rose International**.
            </p>
            <p>
                The opportunity was for a **Danish Bi-Lingual Data Labeling Analyst** role for a client later revealed
                to be **Meta**. The details were highly specific and believable: an onsite position in Menlo Park, CA,
                and a rate of **$28.00/hour**. I spent a dedicated hour revising my resume, eager not to miss the
                chance.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box red-flag">
                <h3>üõë Red Flag #1: The Google Voice Number</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the time difference, Ali called me immediately after sending the email. The number he had on
                    file was a **Google Voice number**. While not definitive proof of a scam, it's a known tactic used
                    by scammers to mask their true international location.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="section-the-phishing-phase">The Phishing Phase: Building Trust and Gathering Data</h2>

            <p>
                The process dragged on for weeks, intentionally building a sense of legitimacy. I had to confirm my U.S.
                Citizenship and my location (I lied and gave a friend's NYC address, still feeling vulnerable).
                Ali even sent back my resume, perfectly **revised and tailored** to match the job description, a common
                psychological trick to make the candidate feel invested and close to an offer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I missed several calls from his "boss," **Puja**, creating a false sense of urgency and fear of missing
                out. The final step was a conversation with Puja where she confirmed my employment history before
                dropping the ultimate request.
            </p>

            <h2 id="section-critical-red-flag">üö® The Critical Red Flag: They Demanded My 1099 or Paystub</h2>

            <p>
                Puja told me Meta wanted to do a background check and asked for proof that I worked at the previous
                employers
                on my resume. Specifically, she requested either a **W-2, a 1099, or a paystub** to verify my previous
                employment.
            </p>

            <div class="cta-box critical-warning">
                <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Your Identity is the Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    **This is the single biggest sign of an identity theft scam.** No employer or recruiter will ever
                    ask for
                    your W-2, 1099, or paystub prior to extending a final job offer. They are trying to steal your
                    Social
                    Security Number, full legal name, and previous employer information for tax fraud and identity
                    theft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did some investigating: a search on Reddit and a query to my AI assistant confirmed the fear. As
                    the
                    AI told me, "it's a big red flag, the reason for that is no employer or recruiter will ever request
                    a
                    W-2 or 1099 for a job application."
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="section-social-warnings">Other Warnings and Final Action</h2>

            <p>
                I was in front of my screen when I got a message from a friend in California. The first thing he said
                after
                I told him the names involved was a strong cultural warning: "Any recruiter that's Indian or Pakistani
                is a
                scam." While that is a harsh generalization and many legitimate companies outsource recruiting, it
                reflects a common experience of people targeted by international fraud rings.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to another friend who experienced a similar attack, most of these scammers are on **LinkedIn**
                to find targets and gather data, proving that vigilance is required even on professional networking
                sites.
            </p>

            <p>
                After an hour of researching and thinking about the matter, I sent an email back to Ali Farhan: **"I'm
                sorry I don't have any documents."**
            </p>

            <p>
                I never heard back.
            </p>

            <h2 id="section-conclusion">In Conclusion: Always Remain Vigilant</h2>

            <p>
                In a tough market, it‚Äôs easy to let desperation cloud your judgment. But if instinctively you feel it‚Äôs
                not
                right, **trust it**. Scammers are experts at creating false websites and faking professional
                communication.
            </p>

            <h3>üîë Your Job Search Security Checklist</h3>
            <ul class="key-takeaways-list">
                <li>**Verify the Domain:** Check the recruiter's email domain against the company's official website.
                    Slight misspellings are a huge red flag.</li>
                <li>**Never Send Tax or ID Documents:** W-2s, 1099s, driver‚Äôs licenses, or Social Security numbers are
                    **NEVER** required pre-offer.</li>
                <li>**Background Checks are Post-Offer:** Legitimate companies only run background checks *after* you
                    have signed an offer letter.</li>
                <li>**Avoid Google Voice Numbers:** Be extremely skeptical of recruiters using VOIP numbers instead of a
                    standard corporate line.</li>
            </ul>
