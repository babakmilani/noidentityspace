                <p class="introduction">A credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, is the single most effective,
                    free tool available to prevent a thief from opening new credit accounts in your name. By locking
                    access to your credit reports, you stop new lenders from viewing your file, which is a prerequisite
                    for most new loans or credit cards.</p>

                    <h2 id="how-it-works">1. What is a Credit Freeze and Why Do You Need One?</h2>
                    <p>A credit freeze locks your file at all three major credit bureaus, preventing potential creditors
                        from accessing it. Since a new lender must pull your credit report to approve a loan, a locked
                        report means no new credit can be issued‚Äînot even by you, unless you temporarily lift the
                        freeze.</p>

                    <h3 class="freeze-facts">Key Facts About Credit Freezes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**It's Free:** Placing, temporarily lifting, or permanently removing a freeze is free of
                            charge at all three bureaus.</li>
                        <li>**It Does Not Affect Your Score:** A credit freeze has no impact on your credit score.</li>
                        <li>**It's Necessary to Contact All Three:** You must contact **Equifax, Experian, and
                            TransUnion** separately to fully protect yourself.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="lift-freeze">3. How to Temporarily Lift or Remove a Freeze</h2>
                    <p>If you need to apply for new credit (like a car loan or a new credit card), you must temporarily
                        lift (or "thaw") the freeze. You can typically schedule a thaw for a specific timeframe (e.g., 5
                        days).</p>

                    <h3 class="thaw-process">Thawing Process & Timing:</h3>
                    <p>When you request an unfreeze online or by phone, agencies are required to lift the freeze within
                        **one hour**. The online process is the quickest and is usually instantaneous.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>**Log In** to your account (myEquifax, Experian, or TransUnion Service Center).</li>
                        <li>**Select** the option to "Temporarily Lift" or "Permanently Remove" the freeze.</li>
                        <li>**Specify** the date range for a temporary lift or simply confirm for a permanent removal.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
